            <p>Yogendra Sarvangasana; Shoulder Stand Pose. The word sarvanga means entire body. From the final position of asana, it can be deduced that it has a favourable effect on entire body. It is strongly advised to attempt this posture first in parts and then complete the pose only after a few weeks of initial training.</p>
